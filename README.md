Plant Guard ‚Äì Agriculture Sector AI Prototype

Plant Guard is a sector-specific AI prototype focused on early plant disease detection. Designed to support agricultural efficiency and food security, this prototype demonstrates how AI can be trained and deployed to assist in real-world applications like plant health monitoring.

Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of agriculture and AI by prototyping an intelligent system that can detect plant diseases from visual input. Using tools like Figma the prototype aims to simulate a scalable, accessible AI-powered diagnostic tool for farmers and agronomists.

Potential Use Cases

Supporting smallholder farmers in diagnosing plant diseases

Assisting agricultural extension workers in the field

Integrating with larger precision farming systems

Ethical & Bias Reflection

AI models in agriculture, while promising, must consider ethical limitations:

Bias in Data: Overfitting to specific crops, regions, or disease types.

Access & Equity: Ensuring tools are usable in low-connectivity areas.

Transparency: Users should understand how predictions are made.

Environmental Cost: Running large-scale AI models must be energy-efficient.

FAQs

Q: Can this be deployed in the real world now?
A: The prototype is a conceptual demonstration. For real-world deployment, further training on diverse datasets and robust testing is needed.

Q: How accurate is the model?
A: Accuracy depends on the dataset used in tools like Teachable Machine or Lobe.ai. This prototype is meant to showcase functionality, not final performance metrics.

Q: Can it detect all types of plant diseases?
A: No. It is limited to the classes the model was trained on. Expansion would require more training data and label accuracy.

Q: Is the model explainable?
A: Tools like Lobe provide some visual explainability, but more work is needed to make predictions transparent to non-technical users.
